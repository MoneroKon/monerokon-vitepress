# Privacy Advocates Gather for Annual Monero Conference in Prague

PRAGUE â€” MoneroKon 2025 is set to take place at Second Culture/La Fabrika in Prague, Czech Republic from 20th to 22nd June 2025. This three-day conference will focus on advancing discussions in security, privacy, and decentralization bringing together global privacy advocates, cypherpunks, and leading experts in financial technology.

MoneroKon, renowned for fostering critical dialogue around privacy-enhancing technologies and decentralized systems, has streamlined its program this year by removing the hackathon component. Instead, attendees can look forward to an in-depth series of presentations and workshops covering topics such as:

* Human Rights and the Blockchain
* Cryptocurrency Laws and Regulations
* Innovative Privacy-Preserving Cryptographic Methods
* New Applications of Zero-Knowledge Cryptography
* Social and Economic Philosophies that Empower Liberty and Decentralization

At present, the detailed speaker schedule has not been announced, but further updates are expected soon.

Tickets for MoneroKon 2025 can be purchased at https://shop.twed.org/twed/MK5/.

Confirmed sponsors include Trocador, Cake Wallet, Monerica, Sweetwater Digital Asset Consulting, Vosto Emisio, and Digilol, showcasing a robust commitment to the core values of privacy and decentralization.

Media representatives interested in covering the event can request press passes by contacting the conference organizers directly.
